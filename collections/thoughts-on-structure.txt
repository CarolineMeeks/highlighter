Option 1: Everything in one collection

Passage {
    title:
    content:
    creating_user:
    wordHighlight_counts: {
	word1: 3,
	word3: 1,
	word5: 12
    }
    highlighting_user {
	userId-1: [word1, word5],
	userId-3: [word5],
	userId-4: [word1, word3, word5]
    }
}



Option 2: An even more compact way. However I think this involves sending students other students highlights and is thus not protective of PII.

Passage {
    title:
    content:
    creating_user:
    wordHighlights: {
	word1: [user1, user3, user5]
	word3: [user3]
	word5: [user1, user2, user3, user5]
    }
}

Option 3: One collection for the passages and one for the user info

UserHighlights {
    userId: user1,{
	passage: [passage1, {
	    wordHighlights: [word1, word3, word5]
	}]
    }
   userId: user2,{
	passage: [passage1, {
	    wordHighlights: [word3, word5]
	}]
    }
}
